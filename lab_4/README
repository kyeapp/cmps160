white light at 1, 1, 1.
smooth/flat shading.
material shininess of 10;

Left click the shark to toggle between flat and smooth shading. 
Right click the shark to toggle between perspective and orthographic view.

Right clicking will still bring up the context menu. I chose not to disable it
because some browsers have security options that do not allow disabling of the context menu.

to change the modelview change x, y, z at the top of prog2_kyeap.js.
x, y, z are the amount to rotate in degrees.
