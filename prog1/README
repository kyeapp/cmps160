Wireframe rending of the Mandelbrot set. wires are set to blue. background is black.
use the textboxes to specify your own coordinates and click generate to produce the image.
an empty textbox is the same as inputting 0.

x and y coordinates go from -255 to 255.
max z is 255.
image was centered at middle of the height before rotation for isometric view.

isometric view point is from [1, 1, 1]
I did a Z rotation followed by an X rotation.

the image is scaled out by a factor of 350 (matrix multiply by 1/350)
